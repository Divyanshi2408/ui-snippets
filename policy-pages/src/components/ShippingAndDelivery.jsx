            For physical certificates, SkillzRevo Solutions Pvt Ltd will arrange for delivery to the
            address provided by you during registration. The learner is responsible for all
            associated costs, including shipping fees, Goods and Services Tax (GST), and any other
            applicable charges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ensure that your address details are accurate and complete to avoid delays or issues with
            delivery. SkillzRevo Solutions Pvt Ltd is not liable for any delivery issues arising from
            incorrect or incomplete address information provided by the learner.

            Delivery times may vary based on your location, the shipping method selected, and other
            logistical factors. Generally, International learners should expect to receive their
            certificates within 15–20 working days, while Domestic learners can expect delivery
            within 10–15 working days. While we strive to deliver your certificate as promptly as
            possible, we cannot guarantee specific delivery dates or times.
          </p>

          <p>
            If there are any discrepancies or problems with the delivery of your certificate, please
            contact us as soon as possible. We will assist in resolving any issues, but SkillzRevo
            Solutions Pvt Ltd is not responsible for delays or losses beyond our control once the
            certificate has been dispatched.
